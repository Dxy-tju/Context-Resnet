# Context-ResNet  
This project use context based method to build a new CNN network called context-resnet.  
We mainly referenced the method in [Inside-Outside Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04143)  
*Current model we trained cannot converge, more model structures should be experimented*  

Current modle structure is shown in the picture below:
